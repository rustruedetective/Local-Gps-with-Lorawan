# Lora-Tracking
This was my fyp's front end.

The lora tracking project takes the current ip of your esp/wifi board which is taking in the rssi signals from lora node.
Then it communicates with the backend and gives us our estimated coordinates.

View the frontend here:-

Notes:
The charts are missing as this was not meant to be hosted on heroku but a proper vps.
Will upload backend code at a later date.
